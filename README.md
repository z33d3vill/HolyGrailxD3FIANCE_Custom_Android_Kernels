This Kernel range will be something truly new to Android Phone Rooters, and the project as a whole will meet and solve many current day issues and "bad development teams" claiming one thing, and failing at even that.. nevermore, my work will speak so I don't have to. 

I'll be featuring Samsung as I own a good few, testers are welcome, but don't pain me, and ask me "when when" I have a life, so all times in-between okay? Bro. 

The kernels are built and produced by a custom set of toolchains I made from scratch myself, using a true gem called Crosstool-ng. 

So, we don't don't generic here.. here, we test and improve all while we impress.

Oh, and C++ has no power here, we believe in PERFORMANCE not "Performance".. so (almost) pure C Kernels, you'll C for yourself. 

Until then, I hope you stay well
